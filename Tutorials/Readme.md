There are a few prepackaged tutorials in Jupyter notebooks meant to demonstrate basic functions of the model. They can
all be run in Google colab


 These have been pre-run and can be opened on github without installation.  With minimal code changes, these can also be
 opened in google colab
* `Demo - Segmentation and Memory Tutorial`: This brief tutorial walks through some basic functions of segmentation and the memory model in a toy 2-d world.  This also includes a comparison between SEM and an HMM in Memory.

* `Demo - Toy Data (Segmentation)`: These simulations demonstrate how SEM can segement simple, 2D dynamical systems with
various different methods of estimating the event dynamics of the system.

* `Demo - HRR.ipynb`: Demonstration of the Holographic reduced representation

* `Demo - Motion Capture Data.ipynb`: Simulations of the SEM model on the 3D motion capture data. 

* `Segmentation - Generalizing Structure`: a demonstratation of how the HRR and Bayesian inference are used
to generalize structure when delineating event boundaries.

# EventSegmentation

Contains the SEM model and a few basic demonstrations. Very much a work in progress and the documentation here lags as 
a consequence.

The main code is listed in the `models` module:
* `models.sem`: contains the code for the SEM model
* `models.event_models`: contains code for the various neural network models used by SEM. They all 
    share a similar structures
    
There are a few prepackaged demonstrations in Jupyter notebooks meant to demonstrate basic functions of the model.
 These have been pre-run and can be opened on github without installation:
* `Demo - Toy Data (Segmentation)`: These simulations demonstrate how SEM can segement simple, 2D dynamical systems with
various different methods of estimating the event dynamics of the system.
* `Demo - HRR.ipynb`: Demonstration of the Holographic reduced representation
* `Demo - Motion Capture Data.ipynb`: Simulations of the SEM model on the 3D motion capture data. 
* `Segmentation - Generalizing Structure`: a demonstratation of how the HRR and Bayesian inference are used
to generalize structure when delineating event boundaries.


There are also multiple simulations that demonstrates how the model can capture a wide range of empirical phenomena
in the event cognition literature:
* `Segmentation - Video (Dishes)`: show human-like segementation of video data, originally used in Zacks & Tversky, 2001.
The dimensionality of the videos has been reduced using a variational auto-encoder, the code for which is available as 
 a seperate library [https://github.com/ProjectSEM/VAE-video](https://github.com/ProjectSEM/VAE-video)
* `Segmentation - Schapiro (n250)`: a simulation of the task found in Schapiro, et al, 2013.
* `Memory Simluation (Bower, 3 setences)`: a simulation of the classic finding in Bower, 1979
* `Memory Simluation (Radvansky & Copeland, 2006)`: a simulation of the findings in Radvansky & Copeland, 2006
* `Memory Simluation (Pettijohn, et al, 2016)`:a simulation of the findings in Pettijohn, et al, 2016
* `Memory Simluation (Dubrow and Davachi, 2013; 2016)`: a simulation of the finding in Dubrow and Davachi, 2013

#### Installation Instructions

This library run on Python 2.7 and uses the tensorflow and keras and libraries for neural networks. 

I recommend using Anaconda python and a virtual environment. [You can find instructions to install Anaconda
 here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/).

Once you have anaconda installed, you can install a virtual environment by running

    conda env create --file environment.yml

This will install everything you need to run the demonstration notebooks.

You'll need to activate the virtual environments and open jupyter to access the demonstration notebooks. To do so, run

    source activate sem
    jupyter notebook


To deactivate the virtual environment, run

    source deactivate


Note: if these instructions do not work for some reason, this library uses:
    Tensorflow v1.9
    Keras v2.2.0
    Anaconda

##### Known issues:

* Progress bars seem to have problems with this installation.
